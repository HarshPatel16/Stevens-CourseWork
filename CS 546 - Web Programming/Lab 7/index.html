    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Howdyyy!! My name is Harsh Patel, I was born in Gujarat,India. So like a typical Indian I like cricket from since I was 3 years old.
        I was like that kid who cries when his/her points get cut and right now I do not have good score right now.<br>
        P.s. I am still that kid haha. So I cry everytime I get a notification "Your instructor has released grades".
    
    <p>
        So, Now I am in the States chasing dreams as I want to collect exotic cars haha. I know I am just being optimistic here. So, nothing interesting in my life.
        Just trying to make good life for me and my family (No, I didn't watch fast and furious recently).
