        <p>
            I am going to talk about the time I chose stevens for masters. This story is just made up. This is not real this
            is for entertainment only. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I was late for applying to colleges and stevens was my last choice so I was waiting for SJSU to reply because
            I wanted to go to california but then SJSU's procedure was long so I accepted stevens offer for backup.<br>
            P.S. SJSU took so much time and their responds used to take so much time        
    </p>
    <p>
        I waited for SJSU's offer for months because they took lot of time and then rejected me so here I am with negetive bank account haha.
